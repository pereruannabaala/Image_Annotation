# Open In Colab: OpenCV Drawing Basics
This project demonstrates fundamental OpenCV drawing operations in Python, including downloading assets, reading images, and drawing basic shapes such as lines, circles, rectangles, and text annotations.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy (numpy)
- Matplotlib (matplotlib)

## Running the Notebook in Google Colab
1. Open the Colab notebook by clicking the "Open in Colab" button.
2. Run all cells to download assets and execute the OpenCV drawing functions.

## Descriptions
The script performs the following actions:
1. Imports necessary libraries:
``os``: For operating system related functionalities.
``cv2``: OpenCV for image processing.
``matplotlib``: For plotting images.
``numpy``: For numerical operations.
``zipfile``: To extract zip archives.
``urllib.request``: To download files from URLs

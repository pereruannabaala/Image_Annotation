# Open In Colab - OpenCV Drawing Operations

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to use OpenCV for drawing basic shapes such as lines, circles, rectangles, and adding text to images. The tutorial covers functional syntax for drawing operations and displays images using Matplotlib.

## Features
- Downloading Assets: Automates downloading and extracting image assets using urllib and zipfile.
- Reading Images: Uses cv2.imread() to load images in color mode.
- Drawing Shapes: Demonstrates OpenCV functions:
  - ```cv2.line()``` – Draws a line with adjustable thickness and style.
  - ```cv2.circle()``` – Creates a circle with defined radius and color.
  - ```cv2.rectangle()``` – Draws a rectangle with customizable line thickness.
  - ```cv2.putText()``` – Adds text annotations using different fonts.
- Displaying Images: Uses ``matplotlib.pyplot`` to render images in a notebook environment.
